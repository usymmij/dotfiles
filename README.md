## Credits
> see youtube link below for GNU stow tutorial referenced

> kickstarted using SolDoesTech's [HyprV2](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV2)

## Spicetify
- under `.config/spicetify/Themes`, make sure to install [spicetify-themes](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes)
- make sure that the themes are in the `Themes` folder, not the new one git created
- you can use the following commands
```bash
cd ~/.config/spicetify/Themes
git clone https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes .
```
